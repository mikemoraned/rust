 "Rust" is a word composed of four successive letters of the alphabet. Are there more?

I hacked together range.pl, and it looks like "rust" is the only one. However, for 5 letter words, we have "struv":

 bash-3.2$ for limit in `seq 2 15`; do echo $limit; cat /usr/share/dict/words | perl range.pl $limit; done
